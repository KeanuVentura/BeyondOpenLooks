# What Makes an NBA Shooter Elite? 

We often hear certain players get labeled as elite shooters — but what does that actually mean? Is it their ability to put up high scoring games? Or their ability
to score consistently while being efficient? Maybe its the types of shots they put up - wide open catch and shoot looks versus step back threes with a hand in their face. As fans of the game, we celebrate the KD's, the Stephs, the Klays of the league, however, what really separates them from your average NBA shooter. 

Which leads me to explore the following question:

#### Are prolific scorers like Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson elite shooters because they get great looks, or because they consistently make tough shots and outperform shot quality metrics?

#### Factors that Contribute to Shot Quality:

- Shot Distance – Closer shots tend to be higher quality.
- Shot Angle / Location – Straightaway vs. corner; paint vs. perimeter.
- Shot Type – Layups, dunks, floaters, catch-and-shoot threes, etc.
- Defender Proximity – Tightly contested shots lower quality.
- Time on Shot Clock – Rushed, late-clock attempts are lower quality.
- Time Context – Time since possession started, time remaining, and period.
- Score Differential – Game situation can impact shot value.
- Assisted vs. Unassisted – Assisted shots often lead to more open looks.
- Possession Type – e.g., transition, offensive rebound, turnover, etc.
- Shot Context – Whether it was a putback or secondary opportunity.
- Game Type – Regular season vs. playoffs.

#### What's NOT Taken Into Account:

- Shooter identity or reputation - Shot Quality is blind to who takes the shot.
- Whether the shot went in – Only the shot's characteristics matter, not the outcome.
